# E2E Atom integration

* Live progress of E2E test script runs, with line-by-line highlighting.
* Pause, resume, and cancel scripts directly from the editor (via menu, control key, or right-click).
* Automatically connects to any running E2E Application (via [socket.io](http://socket.io/) on localhost:4333)

## Upcoming

* Set 'breakpoints' via the Atom editor so that scenarios can be paused and resumed at particular points in each scenario.
